# COTONN v2.0
A tool for converting symbolic controllers to its neural network representation. Based on COTONN in (https://github.com/WardvanderVelden/COTONN). Extends the earlier version with the deterministic case accommodating all grid points, the determinization of the controller, and preserve the minimally-restrictive controllers.
